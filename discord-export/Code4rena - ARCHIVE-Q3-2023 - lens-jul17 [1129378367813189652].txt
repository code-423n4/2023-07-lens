while doing ```forge test``` I'm getting above error can anyone help


[07/18/2023 09:09] klau5_
I think you should do `git submodule update --init --recursive`


[07/18/2023 09:09] saint6704
I did it but I'm still getting the same error


[07/18/2023 09:19] klau5_
Check if the TwoStepOwnable.sol file exist at your local. If exist, I think it's path related problem.. 
 `forge test` works with no special setting for me, so I think you should check your local setting.


[07/18/2023 11:27] johnyboy8854
there are a bunch of cool graphs in the repo (High-level overview of Lens protocol) that are not correctly displayed on the code4rena page. Maybe someone might fix that

I did a `forge install --no-git` and then `forge build` and the build downloaded many dependancies. Perhaps that might help


[07/18/2023 18:57] saint6704
Still not working


[07/18/2023 18:58] parsely.
ok give me 5 min, going to reclone to see if I can replicate


[07/18/2023 18:59] saint6704
sure


[07/18/2023 19:03] parsely.
I recloned, and did nothing else just ran `forge test` it gave me `Missing dependencies found. Installing now...`  I tried from within VS code terminal, and then just using normal command line terminal, both gave the same, are you using Linux?


[07/18/2023 19:23] parsely.
I think I have a way to solve it, what I did was delete (maybe you can just copy elsewhere to keep them) all the folders under /2023-07-lens/lib, then I did a `forge install` and it installed all dependencies, no sure if that helps, I was then able to do a `forge build` and it worked fine


[07/18/2023 19:29] saint6704
I'm using linux and doing everything but it won't work 
I think the dependencies are not installed correctly and hence its showing the same issue


[07/18/2023 19:31] saint6704
I did what you said and it worked perfectly fine
Thanks alot ser

[07/21/2023 15:56] parsely.
Please may I ask for more insight? Why does the code allow  "-" when validating a migration localName but a local one is only allowed "_" eg 
Migrate:
```
if (!_isAlphaNumeric(localNameAsBytes[i]) && localNameAsBytes[i] != '-' && localNameAsBytes[i] != '_') {
                revert HandlesErrors.HandleContainsInvalidCharacters();
            }
```
Validate local:
```
if (!_isAlphaNumeric(localNameAsBytes[i]) && localNameAsBytes[i] != '_') {
                revert HandlesErrors.HandleContainsInvalidCharacters();
            }
```

will the "-" cause any issues if create locally?


[07/21/2023 16:36] neon2835
thanks!


[07/21/2023 16:53] neon2835
why "contracts/modules"  Out of scope ?


[07/21/2023 17:23] parsely.
Please may I ask, what happens if for some reason, a profile can't be migrated?


[07/21/2023 17:36] vicnaum
To focus the audit more on the core features of the protocol


[07/21/2023 17:37] vicnaum
All profiles should be able to be migrated. The only case when migration isn't performed is if profile was already performed. But it doesn't fail - it just skips the profile if it was already migrated.


[07/21/2023 18:31] 0xhuy0512
What is `mirror`?


[07/21/2023 18:33] vicnaum
A `mirror` is like retweet in twitter - a copy of a publication, which just points to original one and doesn't have it's own content

@Alan @Victor Naumik Please may I ask if you have seen this before: Mainnet Migration test gives a different error but not the same as testnet ```
[FAIL. Reason: Setup failed: Memory allocation overflow] setUp() (gas: 0)``` 
I have doubled the memory allocation in foundry.toml


[07/23/2023 07:16] 0xhuy0512
Is the dev's expectation after migration making all the dapp functionality stay the same?


[07/23/2023 07:37] vicnaum
Yes. Of course new features will arise (see the changes in V2 in readme), but general protocol functionality should be smooth


[07/23/2023 07:41] vicnaum
What do you have in your .env? jk 😄
I think we forgot to mention how to setup fork tests in ENV in the readme.

You need to add a the following to your .env if you want to test on a fork:
`TESTING_FORK=mainnet`
(or testnet)

Then it will use a fork to test.
But now I remember why we didn't add it - cause most tests fail with this (we still haven't implemented the support for all the test cases to act on fork). And the reason for that is simple - in most of the tests we assume V2 is already live. But it isn't - it's still V1 on-chain and needs to be upgraded.


[07/23/2023 08:40] 0xhuy0512
For unwrapped follow, we don't have to approve follow, right?


[07/23/2023 09:38] 0xhuy0512
Handle is like username right? Can we trade it like ENS?


[07/23/2023 15:04] saint6704
I think yes all the lens handles are tradable on OS


[07/23/2023 16:55] vicnaum
Yes


[07/23/2023 16:57] 0xhuy0512

[07/23/2023 17:03] donosonaumczuk
ApproveFollow is only for wrapped follow NFTs


[07/23/2023 17:05] 0xhuy0512
so if user A follow user B, user B don't have to approve. if user A wrap his follow, then user B have to approve?


[07/23/2023 17:06] donosonaumczuk
Nono, the ApproveFollow doesn't have anything to do with that


[07/23/2023 17:06] donosonaumczuk
ApproveFollow is like ERC-721 Approve but for follow state instead of ownership state


[07/23/2023 17:07] donosonaumczuk
Basically, A approves C to use his follow NFT to follow B, but A keeps being the owner of the NFT


[07/23/2023 17:11] 0xhuy0512
so after this, A follow B?


[07/23/2023 17:14] donosonaumczuk
1. A follows B. A now owns a Follow NFT of B, and is following B with it. Let's say this NFT has id 7
2. A ApproveFollow C for Follow NFT  7
3. C can now follow B using Follow NFT 7
4. A will still be the owner of the NFT 7, but will stop following B, as C is the one using the NFT to follow B now

Hi @Victor Naumik Just to confirm:  I have added the required values to the .env and can swap between the testnet and mainnet, on testnet it fails as above (https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1129378367813189652/1132400783841820712) and mainnet just gives the memory error, it does not manage to retrieve the profile in the lines in setup() ```
address followNFTAddress = hub.getProfile(idOfProfileFollowed).followNFT;

```

[07/24/2023 13:31] donosonaumczuk
Do you have foundry up to date? Maybe you need to run `foundryup` to update it


[07/24/2023 13:47] donosonaumczuk
Yes, we still have to tweak a bit tests to work in a fork

{Reactions}
🙏 

[07/24/2023 13:58] vicnaum
Yes, so, that happens because the LensHub on-chain is V1 and has a different interface with a different returning type for getProfile - that's why foundry gets lost.
To fix that you need to add a V1 interface somewhere in the test:
```
interface OldLensHub {
    struct ProfileStruct {
        uint256 pubCount;
        address followModule;
        address followNFT;
        string handle;
        string imageURI;
        string followNFTURI;
    }

    function getProfile(uint256 profileId) external view returns (ProfileStruct memory);
}
```

And then change that line to be like this:
```
        address followNFTAddress = OldLensHub(address(hub)).getProfile(idOfProfileFollowed).followNFT;
```

Then this test works.

probably internal macos issue, will try to remove foundry and reinstall it


[07/24/2023 14:22] donosonaumczuk
Yeah, you need to somehow get a foundry version that is at least mid June 2023


[07/24/2023 14:22] donosonaumczuk
That should have the solidity support already, and work


[07/24/2023 14:23] donosonaumczuk
`foundryup` should do the trick, but if for some reason it is not doing it, then remove and install again I guess


[07/24/2023 14:24] mrudenko

[07/25/2023 06:25] 0xhuy0512
I still can't understand the usecase of this


[07/25/2023 07:23] vicnaum
Imagine Vitalik gives perks to his first 100 followers. Alice has a FollowNFT #7 of Vitalik which is cool and valuable, so she doesn't want to sell it. So she decides to rent it to someone else - so she allows Bob to use her FollowNFT #7 to follow Vitalik and get his exclusive content, but the FollowNFT still remains at Alice wallet as she is the owner of the NFT, but the follower recorded in it is Bob. Bob pays Alice some fee for that.

@Victor Naumik Which tokens are included in ModuleGlobals._currencyWhitelisted?


[07/25/2023 08:10] vicnaum
Any ERC20 tokens can be whitelisted, but the governance makes sure they are legit and don't break the protocol

Please may I ask what a referenceModule does? I see how they are connected and stored but what is the purpose of a referenceModule?


[07/27/2023 19:53] vicnaum
If you create a reference publication (comment/quote/mirror) - it goes through the ReferenceModule first (if it's set). You can make things like FollowerOnlyReferenceModule (module checks that only your followers can comment), or DegreesOfSeparationReferenceModule (only people who you follow + N-degrees of separation can comment/quote/mirror your posts), or FeeReferenceModule (pay to comment), or TokenGatedReferenceModule (only holders of BAYC can comment on your post), etc


[07/27/2023 19:54] vicnaum
Reference module is per-Publication based, so you can set a different one (or not set at all) for every publication you make - and then people would have to abide the rules specified when they try to Comment/Quote/Mirror it

The codebase is tight


[07/28/2023 22:46] crypto_s3c
Hi,
For the constructor argument that takes an address, I enter the address 0xdb46d1dc155634fbc732f92e853b10b288ad5a1d and I get the following error:
Error (9429): This looks like an address but has an invalid checksum. Correct checksummed address: "0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d". If this is not used as an address, please prepend '00'.

For example, when I enter an address 0xFABB0ac9d68B0B445fB7357272Ff202C5651694a, I get the following error:
[FAIL. Reason: NotHub()]

Would you please guide me, which address should I use?


[07/29/2023 03:18] donosonaumczuk
Well, it depends of the context of what constructor and what parameter are you passing. I guess because of the error you get,  you need to pass the LensHub?


[07/29/2023 03:18] donosonaumczuk
The first address you passed is ok, just write it in the way as the error outputs it, the case is important for the checksum


[07/29/2023 03:18] donosonaumczuk
So, basically try 0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d


[07/29/2023 03:19] donosonaumczuk

[07/29/2023 03:19] donosonaumczuk

Thank you for your answer


[07/29/2023 12:32] parsely.
@Alan @Victor Naumik  Please may I ask for a bit deeper insight into why address(0) is "valid" in this scenario? I know it is, just asking for more context.
```
address followTokenOwner = _unsafeOwnerOf(followTokenId);
if (followTokenOwner == address(0)) {
   // Follow token is unwrapped.
   // Unfollowing and allowing recovery.
   _unfollow({unfollower: unfollowerProfileId, followTokenId: followTokenId});
            _followDataByFollowTokenId[followTokenId].profileIdAllowedToRecover = unfollowerProfileId;```


[07/29/2023 12:55] parsely.
Please may I ask, just to understand, why can only an EOA have tokenGauadian?


[07/29/2023 15:29] parsely.
Please may I also ask to understand, why is only lowercase handles allowed?


[07/29/2023 15:49] vicnaum
so if the follow is unwrapped its not an ERC721 (it doesnt exist as ERC721) so it cannot have an owner (owner is 0)


[07/29/2023 15:49] vicnaum
when u wrap it - it gets minted and the owner appears


[07/29/2023 15:51] vicnaum
for safety reasons - the contracts might not support disabling the tokenGuardian so the token might be locked forever - so we disable it for all contracts


[07/29/2023 15:51] vicnaum
in future we might have something like SupportsTokenGuardianInteface and then accept such contracts


[07/29/2023 15:51] vicnaum
or even better - have it disabled for contracts by default but allow then to enable it


[07/29/2023 15:52] vicnaum
